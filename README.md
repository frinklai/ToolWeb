# ToolWeb
ToolWeb dataset of 116 point clouds of synthetic household tools with mass and affordance groundtruth for 5 tasks.
By Paulo Abelha


For this dataset we gathered 116 CAD models from 3DWarehouse and re-sampeld an re-meshed them with an automatic Meshlab script.
Additionally, all meshes were segmented using my code for batch segmentation  (guthub.com/pauloabelha/batch_segmentation)

This dataset containts the final re-sampeld/re-meshed and segmented point clouds together with mass and affordance groundtruth for 5 tasks.
